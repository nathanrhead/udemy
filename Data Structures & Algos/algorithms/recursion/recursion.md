# Recursion

Recursion is not an algorithm, but rather a method used in searching and sorting algorithms.

Recursion is used in traversing a directory structure, like in the finder.

E.g., run ls -R to see all the directories, subdirectories, and their files.

Basic recursion requires:

(1) identifying the base case, which stops the recursive function calls;
(2) identifying the recursive case, or the reason to recall the function;
(3) will typically have two returns, one for the base case and one for the recursive function call.
